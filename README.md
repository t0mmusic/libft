# libft

# Purpose
This aim of this project is to create a library of functions for use in later projects at 42. It also introduces the concept of using a Makefile to compile an archive.

# Details
Each function in this archive aims to demonstrate a basic concept in programming, and working in C. This must be achieved with minimal use of external functions. [I have created a more detailed document here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qFLBmnr2daX1P5d8VZxdtetAGpHwkT3gpLQMLSwlACY/edit?usp=sharing)

The code has to meet the standards set by 42, the Norminette. It is then evaluated by 3 peers before being graded by an automated grading system.

# Bonus
The bonus functions revolve around the use of single-linked lists, demonstrating how to access each list in the chain, add content, and remove indiviual list without breaking the chain.

# Status

Complete, passing grade on second attempt.
