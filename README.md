# libft

# Purpose
This aim of this project is to create a library of functions for use in later projects at 42. It also introduces the concept of using a Makefile to compile an archive.

# Details
Each function in this archive aims to demonstrate a basic concept in programming, and working in C. This must be achieved with minimal use of external functions.

The code has to meet the standards set by 42, the Norminette. It is then evaluated by 3 peers before being graded by an automated grading system.

# Bonus
The bonus functions revolve around the use of single-linked lists, demonstrating how to access each list in the chain, add content, and remove indiviual list without breaking the chain.

# Status

Complete, passing grade on second attempt.
